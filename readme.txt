RA Promo Manager
================

Validated, scheduled promotional assets for client WordPress sites — built to replace Soliloquy (unreliable, breaks on WP core updates and jQuery version conflicts) and to unify with NovaSlider (an in-house hero-carousel plugin, already live on kemperhomefurnishings.com) into one system.

== What this solves ==
Non-technical client staff upload promotional graphics that are often the wrong dimensions, the wrong file format, or too large to load quickly. This plugin fixes what's safe to fix automatically, and clearly rejects what isn't: file format and file size are always converted/compressed automatically (no one has to know what WebP is or how to make one), and a picture that's the right *shape* but the wrong resolution is scaled to fit automatically too. A genuinely wrong *shape* offers a crop picker — a 3x3 grid to choose which part of the picture to keep — rather than an automatic guess; only if no choice is made is it a hard rejection, with a clear message about what to fix.

**What isn't caught automatically:** whether the image already has sale text/pricing/dates baked into the pixels, which would visibly clash with the Headline/Subheadline/Button Text fields below it once both render together. Detecting text inside an image needs OCR — a paid cloud API or a server binary this plugin deliberately doesn't depend on, since it'd be an external cost and a point of failure across every client host. Instead, the Add/Edit Asset form has a live preview showing the image and text overlay together exactly as they'll appear live, specifically so this is easy to catch by eye before publishing.

== Getting help ==
**Promo Manager > Help & FAQ** is a plain-language walkthrough and Q&A written for non-technical users, open to anyone who can add assets. There's also a "Help & FAQ" button on the Add/Edit Asset form itself.

== Adding an asset ==
Use **Promo Manager > Add New Asset**. Don't use the native "Add New" screen under Promo Manager > All Assets — it's a bare title field on purpose (no image/format path exists there at all) and will redirect you to the real form automatically.

Creating a new asset walks through four groups in order — The Basics, Your Message, Where It Links, Review & Schedule — with a progress bar and Back/Next buttons, built for an audience with no WordPress experience. **Editing an existing asset skips this entirely**: every group shows on one page at once, nothing hidden, and the same progress bar becomes a set of jump links (click one to scroll straight to that section) — a small edit never requires walking back through the whole guide.

Fields, across whichever view you're in:
- **Kind** — Hero (the full-height carousel), Fold Banner (a shorter strip near the fold), Coupon (a card in a horizontal scrolling row), or Marquee (a small square tile in a compact row, like a "quick links" strip). Switches which image dimensions are required below.
- **Internal Name** — for your own reference in the admin list, not shown publicly.
- **Placement** — which `[rapm_hero placement="..."]` or `[rapm_fold_banner placement="..."]` this belongs to (matched separately per Kind, so a "default" hero and a "default" fold banner don't mix). Leave as "default" unless the site needs more than one of the same Kind (e.g. a homepage hero and a separate category-page hero).
- **Desktop/Mobile images** — upload whatever format/size you have, or choose "Use a link" to point at a file hosted elsewhere (a brand partner's site, a Google Drive share link set to "Anyone with the link"). Either way it's validated and converted automatically; a mismatch tells you the exact dimensions needed vs. what was found. If the picture is a different *shape* than needed, a crop picker appears — a 3x3 grid of anchor points (top-left, center, bottom-right, etc.) — pick which part to keep and it's cropped to fit on save; it defaults to center, so submitting without touching it still works. A linked image is re-checked every hour and updated automatically if the source file changes — if the link ever breaks, the last picture that worked keeps showing and you're emailed once to fix it.
- **Headline / Subheadline / Button Text** — real text rendered over the image, never part of the image file itself. This is what keeps it searchable and accessible, and lets you fix a typo without re-uploading anything.
- The **Live Preview** has a Desktop/Mobile toggle — switch to Mobile to confirm the phone picture (or, if none was uploaded, to see the desktop picture shrunk to fit the phone shape instead — nothing is ever cropped off) before saving.
- **Text Alignment / Text Color / Text Style** — control how that text looks. The Live Preview updates as you change them.
- **Typeface** — only shown on sites running Elementor with fonts already set up under Site Settings > Global Fonts. Lets the promotion's text use one of those same site fonts (by name — "Primary," "Secondary," or whatever the site calls them) instead of a generic style, and keeps tracking that font automatically if it's ever changed in Elementor later.
- **Link** — a plain web address, a page/post on this site, or (if WooCommerce is active) a specific product, a category, a brand, search results for some words, or a hand-picked list of SKUs with automatic fill-in. For anything other than a plain web address, start typing a name and pick from the matches — no ID numbers needed. A hand-picked list can also be built by uploading a spreadsheet (.csv or Excel .xlsx) with a "SKU" column instead of searching one at a time; any SKUs not found on the site are reported back and downloadable as their own list.
- **Schedule** — start/end date-time. Works correctly even behind a full-page cache plugin (WP Rocket etc.) — the schedule is checked in each visitor's own browser, not baked into a cached page, so nothing "freezes." A live note right below these fields tells you directly whether this specific promotion will show up on the Promotions Calendar (see below) or not, based on whether both dates are filled in — updates the moment you add or remove one.

== Managing what you've built ==
**Promo Manager > Sliders** groups every asset by Kind+Placement into cards — one card per carousel, each showing a thumbnail, slide count, how many are live right now, and its shortcode. Click a card to open its slide list and drag to reorder (persists automatically, no save button needed) or Edit/Duplicate/Trash a slide directly. A banner at the top of this page also surfaces the Promotions Calendar shortcode plus a live count of how many promotions currently qualify for it — the calendar has no menu item of its own, since it isn't a separate thing to manage, just a different view of the same promotions.

**Promo Manager > All Assets** now has Type and Placement filter dropdowns above the list, and a "Duplicate" row action (next to Edit/Trash) that creates a draft copy of an asset with all its settings and images intact — useful for a new promotion that's a small variation on an existing one.

== Displaying a carousel ==
`[rapm_hero]` — the full hero carousel, "default" placement.
`[rapm_fold_banner]` — the shorter fold-banner carousel, "default" placement.
`[rapm_hero placement="category-living-room"]` — a separate carousel scoped to just that placement (works the same for `[rapm_fold_banner]`).
An Elementor widget ("Promo Carousel," under the Promo Manager category) wraps either shortcode via its own Kind control.
`[rapm_curated_results]` — put this on one plain page, then set its address under Promo Manager > Settings > Curated Results Page. Every "hand-picked list" link on the site reuses this one page automatically.

== Other display modes ==
`[rapm_marquee items="4"]` — a compact row of square image tiles, "items" (1–5) controlling how many show at once. Extra tiles page in like a carousel (Prev/Next buttons plus an optional timer, both configurable under Settings) rather than showing all at once. Add assets with Kind set to Marquee.
`[rapm_coupon_book]` — a horizontal scrolling row of coupon cards (Kind: Coupon).
`[rapm_promotions_calendar]` — a month calendar of every promotion (any Kind) that has both a start and end date set. Add `placement="..."` or `kind="..."` to scope it. This is RA Promo Manager's own promotions calendar — a different thing from any separate community-events-calendar plugin the site might also run, and it has no public submission form; every promotion on it comes from the Add/Edit Asset admin form. Its accent color (the highlight on days with a promotion, and the day-detail links) automatically matches this site's Elementor "Accent" or "Primary" Global Color when Elementor is active — override it with an exact hex under Promo Manager > Settings > Brand Color if it picks the wrong one, or the site doesn't use Elementor.
Marquee, Coupon Book, and Calendar don't have their own Elementor widgets yet — use Elementor's own Shortcode widget with the shortcodes above in the meantime.

== Image specs (defaults — adjustable under Promo Manager > Settings) ==
- Hero Desktop: 1920x600px, WebP, under 300KB
- Hero Mobile: 1080x1920px, WebP, under 300KB
- Fold Banner Desktop: 1920x300px, WebP, under 200KB
- Fold Banner Mobile: 1080x400px, WebP, under 200KB
- Coupon Card: 600x750px, WebP, under 150KB (same size used for both desktop and mobile)
- Marquee Tile: 1080x1080px (Instagram's standard square size), WebP, under 200KB (same size used for both desktop and mobile)

The hero numbers were checked against real Core Web Vitals/LCP guidance, not picked arbitrarily. The fold banner and coupon card numbers are documented starting points, not external standards — no established industry convention exists for either shape (checked directly) — adjust freely if a site's own data says otherwise. See CHANGELOG.md for the full research trail.

== Requirements ==
PHP with either the Imagick extension (preferred) or GD's WebP support, for automatic format conversion. If a host has neither, the plugin will clearly say so and ask for a pre-converted .webp file instead of failing silently.

== Roadmap ==
Phase 1 (asset core + hero + fold banner) through the coupon book/marquee/calendar phase are all built. Not yet built: dedicated Elementor widgets for Marquee/Coupon Book/Calendar (shortcodes work today via Elementor's Shortcode widget).
